Autotags
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beraboris/autotags.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beraboris/autotags)

A little tool that watches a given directory and generates
[ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) whenever you save your code.

Why?
----

Many editors and tools make use of ctags to provide a better coding experience.
This is great. The only issue is that every time you add a class, function,
variable, method, etc. you need to run ctags again so that your editor knows
about your new code. Autotags solves that issue by keeping an eye on your files
and then running ctags for you when anything changes.
